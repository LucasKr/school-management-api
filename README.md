# Academic Management

A RESTful API to manage a college application.

# What do I use

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA

# DataBase configuration

You'll need to have an user in your database called `springuser` and set his password as `123`. After having this user you need to guarantee all previleges to change the database. 

Now, just create the database `academic_management`, then you'll be able to build and run the project.
  

# First release

It should only respond to HTTP requests through tools like `curl` or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

# Later

It should have a client-side application built in a JS Framework (either Angular.js or React.js and its libraries)
