# Academic Management

A RESTful API to manage a college application.

# What do I use

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA

# First release

It should only respond to HTTP requests through tools like `curl` or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

# Later

It should have a client-side application built in a JS Framework (either Angular.js or React.js and its libraries)
